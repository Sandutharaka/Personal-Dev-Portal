What was easy?
- Setting up the project with Vite and integrating Tailwind CSS was straightforward.
- Creating simple React components like the live clock and about me section was easy using functional components and hooks.

What was hard?
- Debugging issues related to TypeScript types and ensuring all dependencies worked well together took some time.
- Styling components to look good and be responsive with Tailwind required some trial and error.

What did AI help you with?
- AI helped generate boilerplate code for React components and provided suggestions for fetching data (like the fun fact API).
- It also assisted in configuring project files and resolving some TypeScript errors.

What suggestions did you reject and why?
- I rejected suggestions that added unnecessary complexity or extra dependencies, focusing on keeping the project simple and easy to maintain.

What would you add if you had more time?
- I would add more interactive features, such as a to-do list or a notes section.
- I would also improve the UI/UX and add tests to ensure code quality.
